# RStudio

* RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE)
* Widely used way of writing R code and interacting with data.

Let's take a little tour:

1. Source: R code files:
    * ".R" files: scripts
    * ".Rmd" files: "R Markdown", interactive notebooks that can be saved as latex/pdf or html documents. Handy for exploring data, making graphs, and keeping track of why you are making particular decisions.
  
2. Console
    * Another way to code interactively!
    * Also has a terminal (the same as terminal/command line)

3. Files/Plots/Help
    * Useful references for while doing data analysis and writing code

4. Environment
    * variables that you've saved that are available for you to use.
